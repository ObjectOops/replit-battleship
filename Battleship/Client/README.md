# Replit Battleship  
This game is self explanatory, please launch it and see the rules if it is not.  
*Please note that some graphics may be truncated if the terminal window is too small.*  
**Have fun!**  

Known bugs, issues, and improvements that should be addressed:
- Poor connection performance (using the curl binary instead of libcurl or sockets).
- There is a lack of backend data validation.
- Raw terminal input has strange effects, but alternatives seem too constrained.
- If one player disconnects in a game the other one remains pinging in an endless loop.
- Using a library for the TUI would be a great readability improvement.
- And more.
