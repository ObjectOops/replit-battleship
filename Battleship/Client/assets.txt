Rules for BattleShip (a Milton Bradley Game)

        Game Objective
The object of Battleship is to try and sink all of 
the other player's before they sink all of 
your ships.
All of the other player's ships are somewhere on 
his/her board.
You try and hit them by calling out the coordinates 
of one of the squares on the board.
The other player also tries to hit your ships by 
calling out coordinates.
Neither you nor the other player can see the 
other's board so you must try to guess where 
they are.
Each board in the physical game has two grids:
  the lower (horizontal) section for the player's 
  ships 
  and the upper part (vertical during play) 
  for recording the player's guesses.

        Starting a New Game
Each player places the 5 ships somewhere on their 
board.
The ships can only be placed vertically or 
horizontally.
Diagonal placement is not allowed.
No part of a ship may hang off the edge of the 
board.
Ships may not overlap each other.
No ships may be placed on another ship.

Once the guessing begins, the players may not move 
the ships.

The 5 ships are:
  Carrier (occupies 5 spaces)
  Battleship (4)
  Cruiser (3)
  Submarine (3)
  and Destroyer (2).

        Playing the Game
Player's take turns guessing by calling out 
the coordinates.
The opponent responds with "hit" or "miss" 
as appropriate.
Both players should mark their board with pegs:
  red for hit, 
  white for miss.
For example, if you call out F6 and your opponent 
does not have any ship located at F6, your 
opponent would respond with "miss".
You record the miss F6 by placing a white peg on 
the lower part of your board at F6.
Your opponent records the miss by placing.

When all of the squares that one your ships 
occupies have been hit, the ship will be sunk.
You should announce "hit and sunk".
In the physical game, a red peg is placed on the 
top edge of the vertical board to indicate a sunk 
ship.

As soon as all of one player's ships have been sunk, 
the game ends.
