This archive contains source code for an online variant of the board game Battleship intended to be run within a Replit environment (NixOS).


[Content redacted.]


Located in the folder labeled as `Client` is the source code for the launcher, a separate program from the game that sets environment variables and functions as a primitive anticheat. For this reason, it is not located in the original source code linked above, and is exclusively included with this archive as `launcher.cpp`.
Also note that the `Makefile` provided is solely decorative (see `_.replit`) and actual compilation occurs through the script called `compile.sh`.
