This game was originally created as an educational project, but has since been used for a number of other purposes - such as the making of the video above.  
As a result, there will be multiple readme files. Some content has been redacted for publication purposes.  
All code is legacy and should not be expected to work on updated systems or platforms outside the one it was intended for.
